**COMP20 Assignment 1: Portfolio**

In this assignment I created a website to display my resume and bio. I did so
using HTML and CSS. My three HTML files index, resume, and bio each display
my homepage, resume, and bio respectively. I used div tags in my HTML files
to style my own elements with rules in my CSS file. This made design much
easier and removed the need to use style tags in the HTML files. 

As part of the assignment, I constantly used git to push changes to my master
branch. I attempted to add meaningful messages to each commit, but I could
still improve by providing much more detail. 

I spent about 3 hours total on this assignment.
