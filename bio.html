                <p>I'm 21 years old, and I currently study Computer Science and Linguistics at Tufts University. I grew up in Memphis, TN and went to a small, private, all-girls school called Hutchison from kindergarten to graduation. I moved to Boston, MA to attend college and expect to graduate in 2019. I enjoy playing video games, spending time with friends, and watching documentaries when I'm not in Halligan working on a program. I hope to one day be a software engineer and own at least two dogs.</p>
